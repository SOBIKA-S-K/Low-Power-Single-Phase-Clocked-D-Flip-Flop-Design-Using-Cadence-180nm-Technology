# Low-Power-Single-Phase-Clocked-D-Flip-Flop-Design-Using-Cadence-180nm-Technology
ðŸ”§ Project: Low Power TSPC D-Flip-Flop in Cadence 180nm
ðŸ“‚ Tools: Cadence Virtuoso, Verilog HDL
ðŸ“Ž Technology: 180nm CMOS

This project presents the design and simulation of a low-power, single-phase clocked D Flip-Flop using TSPC logic. It integrates input-aware precharging and floating node analysis techniques to achieve high energy efficiency while maintaining performance.

âœ… Key Features:

80% power reduction compared to traditional TGFF designs at 10% activity

26.18% improvement in clock-to-Q delay

Minimal area increase (4.8%) with no impact on functionality

Fully verified via transistor-level simulations and post-layout waveform analysis

ðŸ“ˆ Outcome:
Ideal for low-voltage, low-power sequential designs in ASIC flows and embedded applications.
